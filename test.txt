The Great Library of Aetheria

In the ancient city of Aetheria, the Great Library stood at the heart of the kingdom. Founded in 1120 AD by the scholar Eleanor Windrider, it was known to house over 10,000 ancient scrolls.

Eleanorâ€™s closest allies were Magnus Thorn, a renowned cartographer, and Selene Vale, a master healer. Together, they traveled across the kingdoms of Drakoria, Velwyn, and Sorenthia to collect lost artifacts and forgotten knowledge.

The Great Library contained rare works, such as:

- The Book of Stars (written by Orin Flameheart in 980 AD)

- The Herbal Codex (compiled by Selene Vale in 1105 AD)

- The Map of the Endless Seas (drawn by Magnus Thorn during his expedition to Velwyn)

In 1150 AD, a fire broke out in the Alchemy Wing of the Library, rumored to have been caused by a failed experiment by an apprentice named Tobias Grey. Although much of the Herbal Collection was damaged, The Book of Stars was saved by a young librarian, Lucan Storm.

Following the fire, the King of Aetheria, King Roderic IV, funded the Library Restoration Project. He appointed Master Architect Lydia Moor to rebuild and expand the library with a new Astronomy Tower and a Hall of Healing.

Over time, the Library became not just a storehouse of knowledge but also a training ground for scholars, healers, and cartographers across the realm.
